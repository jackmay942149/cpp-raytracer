# C++ Raytracer
Learning Raytracing in C++ with assistance from [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
Requires g++ to build from source.
Requires ppm viewer, my personal suggestion is [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)

## **Compilation Steps (Requires g++):**
1. Run build.bat
2. Wait

## **Alternative Compile Steps:**
1. Enter "g++ -o build/main src/vec.cpp src/sphere.cpp src/main.cpp src/scene.cpp src/rand.cpp src/material.cpp" in top-directory
*Note: if compilation errors double check the command above matches that in the build.bat file*
2. Run build/main.exe
3. Open file res/example.ppm
